I have read the CSE departmentâ€™s anti-cheating policy available at https://www.cse.
iitk.ac.in/pages/AntiCheatingPolicy.html. I understand that plagiarism is a severe
offense. I have solved this assignment myself without indulging in any plagiarism.
If my submission is found to be plagiarized from the internet, fellow students, etc.,
then strict action can be taken against me.

I have used GeeksForGeeks, Stackoverflow, linux manpages and such websites to get to know about how the syscalls are implemented according to the needs of the questions. For ex- how to find the size of a directory, how to read input outputs from pipes, how a void* linked list works(intialisation, updation) etc.
